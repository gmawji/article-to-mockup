You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  * None yet, I already have the grasp of the basics of HTML and CSS. Refreshing never hurts though :)
  * All of it has been easy so far.
  * Nothing has been difficult yet.
  * Already knew the issues, had to remind myself to use <s></s> instead of <strike></strike> though.
